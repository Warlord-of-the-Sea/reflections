QUESTION:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you've completed a new feature or when you want to back up your current work.

QUESTION:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because you may just be trying out something experimental that you don't want to push to the
	remote repository.
	
QUESTION:Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
		Fork is used to copy a repository onto your own github account. You clone a repo when you
		want to bring it down to your local machine. Finally you use branch to make changes to the
		code without modifying the orginial

QUESTION:What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
		It allows you to edit the most recent code changes without being connected to the internet.
		It allows you to continue working even when internet is not availible. (Yes, I did just
		basically restate myself)

QUESTION:How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
What would be easier, and what would be harder?
		You would have to collaborate using things like dropbox or google drive to share different
		versions of the code. Accessing different versions would be much harder to do and not as fast
		either. I don't really know what would be easier about version control w/o github. It seems
		like a really useful tool that does all of the essentials well.
